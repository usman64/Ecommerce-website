Things done in Section 6: Lesson 4 (1/2)

- added a Shop page
- a collection-preview and collection-item component with styles
- a Header component

  - text-decoration none
  - styling
  - using <Link> tag
  - adding an svg icon

    - In the previous lesson, you may have seen the strange syntax: import { ReactComponent as Logo }

    This is a new special syntax when importing SVG in React. The ReactComponent import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename. You can read more about it here, but keep in mind that this is a React library special syntax:
